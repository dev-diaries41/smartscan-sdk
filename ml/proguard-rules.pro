# Keep ONNXRuntime classes and their native methods to prevent obfuscation
-keep class ai.onnxruntime.** { *; }
-keepclassmembers class ai.onnxruntime.** {
    native <methods>;
}

# Optionally, keep any class that contains native methods
-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    native <methods>;
}

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
